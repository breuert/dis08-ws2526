# Command Line Interface

> [!NOTE]
> In this assignment, you will explore the basics of Linux shell commands through interactive lessons and a text-based adventure game. By the end, you should feel more comfortable navigating the filesystem, executing commands, and understanding how the shell fits into the broader computing environment.

1. Visit [https://linuxjourney.com/the-shell](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell). Read each of the 19 lessons (left) and exercises (upper right) carefully. Answer the quizzes (lower right) and document your answers in a Markdown-formatted file `linuxjourney.md` and add it to your repository. Please remember that you can also document your command line outputs with verbatim code.

2. Visit [https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl](https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl) and learn Linux commands by playing a simple text adventure. Please follow the instructions provided in the README of the `bashcrawl` repository. Once you finish the game, create a file with your command history and add it to this subfolder - for instance, with the help of `history -100 >> bashcrawl.log`. You can also upload a Markdown file that documents your history with verbatim code. Please pay attention that you upload the full history beginning with `cd ./bashcrawl/entrance/`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By the end of this assignment, your repository should include:
> - A Markdown file `linuxjourney.md` containing quiz answers from the Linux Journey lessons that may also include examples of commands and outputs (in code blocks).
> - A log file called `bashcrawl.log` with the full command history of your Bashcrawl session, starting from `cd ./bashcrawl/entrance/`. (Alternatively, a Markdown file documenting the session step by step with commands and outputs.)
